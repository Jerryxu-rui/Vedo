    "**SCENE 1: SOLITUDE AND FOREBODING**\n\nSHOT 1: INT. LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER'S QUARTERS - DAY\nSARAH (40s, weathered face, weary eyes) sits at a table, meticulously cleaning a nautical chart. The room is sparsely furnished. GUS, a scruffy dog, lies at her feet. Sunlight streams in, casting long shadows.\n\nSHOT 2: CLOSE UP - SARAH'S HANDS\nHer hands, calloused and strong, smooth a crease in the chart. A simple WEDDING RING is on her finger.\n\nSHOT 3: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY\nThe lighthouse, a tall white sentinel, stands against a deceptively calm sea. The sky is a pale, unsettling grey.\n\nSHOT 4: INT. LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER'S QUARTERS - DAY\nSarah looks out the window, a flicker of unease in her eyes. Gus whines softly, nudging her hand. \n\nSARAH\n(Softly)\nEasy, boy.\n\nSHOT 5: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY\nThe wind picks up. The lighthouse GROANS faintly. Dark clouds gather ominously on the horizon.\n\n**SCENE 2: THE STORM'S FURY**\n\nSHOT 1: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - NIGHT\nA colossal wave crashes against the lighthouse base. The structure SHUDDERS violently. Rain lashes down.\n\nSHOT 2: INT. LAMP ROOM - NIGHT\nSarah struggles to keep the lamp lit. Wind HOWLS. Rain streaks the glass. Gus barks frantically, tail between his legs.\n\nSHOT 3: CLOSE UP - SARAH'S FACE\nIlluminated by the lamp's flashing beam, her face shows determination mixed with fear. Spray from a rogue wave soaks her.\n\nSHOT 4: INT. LAMP ROOM - NIGHT\nThe lamp flickers, threatening to extinguish. Sarah desperately adjusts the fuel flow. Gus pushes against her leg.\n\nSARAH\n(Grunting with effort)\nHold on, hold on...\n\nSHOT 5: INT. LAMP ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nSarah manages to stabilize the lamp. The beam shines brightly through the storm. She leans against the mechanism, exhausted.\n\n**SCENE 3: DAWN AND RESILIENCE**\n\nSHOT 1: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAWN\nThe coastline is ravaged. Debris litters the shore. The storm has passed. The sea is calmer, but churned.\n\nSHOT 2: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS\nSarah stands outside, looking at the sea. Her face is etched with exhaustion, but her eyes hold newfound strength. Gus sits beside her, panting, but alert.\n\nSHOT 3: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS\nSarah reaches down and strokes Gus's head.\n\nSARAH\n(Voice thick with emotion)\nWe did it, boy. We did it.\n\nSHOT 4: EXT. SEA - DAWN\nA distant SHIP sounds its horn in acknowledgement.\n\nSHOT 5: EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAWN\nSarah turns back to the lighthouse, a sense of purpose returning to her. Gus barks once, a sound of agreement and companionship. The light shines steadily. FADE OUT."
