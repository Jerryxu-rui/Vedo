The woman, positioned in the center of the frame, is wearing loose-fitting clothes. Her face shows exhaustion, but her eyes reflect a newfound strength. A medium-sized, scruffy mixed-breed dog sits beside the woman on the left, panting, yet alert. A lighthouse looms behind the woman. The sea stretches out on the right side of the frame. The lighting is soft, suggesting early morning or late afternoon, casting a gentle glow on the scene. The color palette is muted, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere."
