Full Story Narrative:

Scene One: The Stillness Before the Storm

Shot 2: Close-up on Sarah's hands, weathered and calloused, as she smooths out a crease in the chart. A wedding ring is visible on her left hand.
Shot 3: Exterior shot of the lighthouse, a tall, white structure against a deceptively calm sea. The sky is a pale, unsettling grey.
Shot 4: Back inside, Sarah looks out the window at the sea, a flicker of unease in her eyes. Gus whines softly and nudges her hand. "Easy, boy," she murmurs, but her voice lacks its usual firmness.
Shot 5: The wind picks up audibly. The lighthouse begins to groan faintly.

Scene Two: The Fury of the Sea

Shot 1: High angle shot of the lighthouse as a massive wave crashes against its base. The structure shudders violently.
Shot 2: Interior of the lamp room at the top of the lighthouse. Sarah struggles to keep the lamp lit as the wind howls and rain lashes against the glass. Gus barks frantically, his body tense.
Shot 3: Close-up on Sarah's face, illuminated by the flashing lamp. She's determined but her eyes betray fear. A rogue wave sends spray through a crack in the window, soaking her.
Shot 4: The lamp flickers and threatens to go out. Sarah fights to adjust the fuel flow, her movements desperate. Gus pushes against her leg, a constant source of support.
